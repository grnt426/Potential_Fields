Project Name:   Potential Fields

Description:    Agents employ path-finding techniques on their own by having
                known areas of interest generate an attractive field very
                similar to that seen in magnetic fields.  If agents need to
                stay a certain distance away from a target, then the target
                can give off a negative field in the desired region the agent
                should stay away from, and then have a very positive field
                emanating from the edges.  Agents themselves can give off a
                very small field immediately around their occupied space,
                forcing agents to space themselves appropriately.  These few
                rules and suggestions, combined with pheromone trails,
                backtracking, etc. allow for effective path-finding along with
                very interesting emergent behavior that is seen as a side
                affect of these implementations.
                The particular goal of the agents is to destroy a given target
                with ranged weaponry (lasers).

Technical Details of Algorithm:
                > Not quite yet decided as I will be experimenting with various
                forms of data storage, agent behavior, and Potential Field
                (PF) creation, modification, and types/number of fields.
                > However, for right now the basic idea will be to have targets
                give off a repelling field directly around their area, and then
                a powerful attractive force outside of this area.  Agents
                (or units) will move directly towards their target without any
                backtracking, pheromone trails, or other aids aside from their
                own small negative field to avoid collision with other
                units (allies).
