Immediate TODO:
        > Allow the creation of static objects
        > Allow weights to be applied based on distance (for ranged units)
        > Finish cleaning up the PFMap class (mostly method signatures)

Eventual Updates:
        > Optimize, Optimize, Optimize
        > Fix the weird bug with Java not using my FieldType .equals() method
            for key comparison (currently, the FieldType's name is stored as
            the key directly)
        > Fix the ConcurrentModificationException as mentioned in the
            getHighestCharge() method of the FieldNode class
